Title: Shrinking in response to heat stress and social status aids survival in anemonefish 
Authors: "Melissa Versteeg, Chancey MacDonald, Morgan Bennett-Smith, Peter Buston, Theresa Rueger"

[Access this dataset on Github](Dataset DOI link)

The dataset contain the data files underlying clown anemonefish shrinking (PercentChange_Versteeg_etal_2024 data file),
shrinking of rank 2 males in response to size ratios (Rank2Shrinking_Versteeg_etal_2024 data file), as well as the overall 
survival of individual anemonefish in response to environmental and social factors Survival_Versteeg_etal_2024 data file).

The dataset from which temperatures were projected is also included ()

We have also included the code for the Bayesian models of thermal stress, social factors, growth patterns, size ratios and suvival probabilities. The code includes their respective model fit checks and plots. 

Data was collected over five lunar cycles, spanning February - August 2023
(study period: 180 days), in Kimbe Bay, Papua New Guinea (5°30’S, 150°05’E).


Description of the data and file structure:
Each dataset is available as a separate excel workbook. Data observations are presented in tab 1 ("Data") and variable descriptions and measurement units are found in tab 2 ("Variables").
